# Authentication

Kinetix has two independent auth surfaces: **virtual keys** for inference
clients, and **admin auth** for the dashboard/API.

## Virtual keys (clients)

- A virtual key has the form `sk-kinetix-…`, is shown **once** at creation, and
  is stored only as a SHA-256 hash.
- Clients present it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (OpenAI clients) or
  `x-api-key: <key>` (Anthropic clients). Both are accepted on `/v1/*`.
- Lookup is by hash with a constant-time comparison.

A key can carry optional limits (see [Usage, Cost and Accounting](Usage-Cost-and-Accounting)):

- allowed models/aliases/Routes (`*` wildcard and prefix matching, e.g. `gemini-*`)
- allowed providers (a Route never serves a key a provider it is not permitted)
- requests/minute (RPM) and tokens/minute (TPM)
- daily and monthly USD budgets
- expiry
- an IP allowlist (exact addresses and CIDR)
- a per-key body-logging flag

Enforcement order on `/v1/*`:

```
per-IP abuse limit  →  virtual-key auth  →  IP allowlist  →  limits (status/expiry/models/RPM/TPM/budget)
```

Client IP is taken from the trusted ingress headers `CF-Connecting-IP`, then the
first `X-Forwarded-For` hop, then `X-Real-IP` (sound because cloudflared is the
sole ingress).

Revocation and limit changes take effect within a few seconds without a restart.

## Admin auth

The dashboard/API uses a **password + in-memory session** model:

- The admin password is generated on first run and printed once; only its hash is
  stored (DB setting `admin_password_hash`, with a `<config_dir>/admin_password.hash`
  file fallback).
- Logging in mints a random session token stored **in memory** and sets an
  `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie. Sessions have a TTL
  (`KINETIX_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES`, default 12h).
- A **server restart invalidates every session**, and **changing the password
  invalidates all sessions** — so the dashboard requires re-login after a restart.
- For CLI/curl, the header `x-kinetix-admin-token` may carry either a live session
  token or the raw admin password. A raw password is **never** accepted from the
  cookie.

```bash
# Log in and reuse the cookie
curl -c cookie.txt -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/api/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"password":"..."}'
curl -b cookie.txt http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/api/overview
```

## Cloudflare Access (production)

Set `KINETIX_CF_ACCESS_AUD` and `KINETIX_CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` to require a valid
Cloudflare Access JWT (`cf-access-jwt-assertion`) in addition to the password/
session check. Kinetix validates the JWT (RS256) against the team's JWKS with the
configured audience. Leave it unset to rely on the password/session alone
(convenient in dev).

## Design notes

- Upstream credentials are encrypted at rest with the master key and never
  exposed by the API (only a mask).
- Admin **mutations fail closed** when the store is degraded; admin reads and
  inference keep working.
- Secrets, auth headers, and prompt/completion bodies are never logged by default
  (see [Observability](Observability) and [Security](Security)).
