# Kinetix Wiki

Kinetix is a single self-hosted Rust service that speaks the **OpenAI Chat
Completions** and **Anthropic Messages** wire formats (streaming first) in front
of admin-configured upstream LLM APIs, and layers on virtual keys, account pools
with executable **Routes** and automatic fallback, cost tracking, and an embedded
admin dashboard. It is built for developers and small technical teams running AI
coding agents such as [Pi](https://pi.dev).

This wiki is the detailed, task-oriented companion to the repo
[`README.md`](https://github.com/PrightCord/kinetix/blob/main/README.md).

## What it is (and isn't)

- **Is**: a private, single-binary gateway for coding agents; correctness of the
  wire protocol and routing decisions matters more than breadth.
- **Isn't**: a general-purpose AI platform, a multi-tenant SaaS, or a bundled
  provider-preset library. See the non-goals in
  [docs/DESIGN.md](https://github.com/PrightCord/kinetix/blob/main/docs/DESIGN.md).

## Editing this wiki

The wiki pages are generated from the markdown files in
[`docs/wiki/`](https://github.com/PrightCord/kinetix/tree/main/docs/wiki). Edit
them there (so changes are reviewed and versioned with the code) and mirror them
to the GitHub wiki with:

```bash
scripts/publish-wiki.sh "docs(wiki): describe your change"
```

The script clones `<repo>.wiki.git`, copies `docs/wiki/*.md` over it, and pushes.
If the wiki git repository does not exist yet, enable the wiki in the repo
settings and create **one page** in the web UI first (GitHub only provisions
`<repo>.wiki.git` after the first page exists), then re-run the script.
`Home.md` is the wiki landing page.
