# Usage, Cost and Accounting

Kinetix records a usage row per request (asynchronously, never blocking the data
plane) and computes cost from the model's configured prices. A guiding principle
is **"unknown means unknown"**: Kinetix never invents token counts or costs.

## What is recorded

Each usage row holds: request id, timestamp, key id/name, client format,
requested/effective model, Route id/name, fallback hops/path, status + status
code, latency, TTFT, input/output/cached/thinking tokens, cost + `cost_known`,
`usage_confidence`, `commit_state`, retry count, cache status, serving
account/provider (admin-only), the opaque Route id, the upstream request id, a
`flagged` marker, and any error message.

## Confidence states

| Field | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `usage_confidence` | `provider_reported` | The upstream reported the counts. |
| | `estimated` | A derived/partial count. |
| | `unknown` | Not known (e.g. a client disconnect). |
| `cost_known` | `1` / `0` | Whether the model has prices so cost could be computed. |

Unknown token counts are **omitted** from client responses rather than coerced to
zero. A spend total is never presented as complete when some usage is unpriced —
the overview/metrics also expose `unknown_usage_requests`, `estimated_usage_requests`,
and `unknown_cost_requests`.

## Cost

Cost is billed per 1M tokens: `(input − cached) × input + cached × cached_price +
output × output + thinking × thinking_price`. Cached defaults to the input price
and thinking to the output price. **If prices are unconfigured, cost is `None`
(unknown), not `0.0`.** A `price_versions` table keeps price history so past costs
stay reproducible.

## Per-key limits and budgets

Enforced before proxying:

- **RPM** / **TPM** over the last 60 seconds.
- **Daily** / **monthly** USD budgets.
- Status (revoked → 401, disabled → 403), expiry, allowed models, IP allowlist.

Inference admission is atomic per virtual key. Kinetix reserves one RPM slot,
a conservative token allowance, and conservative priced spend before dispatch.
Active reservations participate in later admission decisions immediately, so a
concurrent burst cannot all observe the same stale counter. Complete provider
usage reconciles the reservation after the request; partial/unknown usage keeps
the conservative reservation.

The in-memory ledger is seeded once from durable usage history. After that,
usage-log writes are for reporting/accounting durability rather than admission
correctness: an async/dropped log cannot reopen capacity in the running process.
If historical counters cannot be read during startup/first use, Kinetix starts
that key's in-memory ledger from zero so a control-plane outage still does not
take down the data plane.

USD reservation remains unavailable when any possible target is unpriced.
Kinetix does not invent vendor prices.

## Usage views

- **Dashboard → Usage & Spend** — spend vs budgets per key, a Today / 24h / 7d /
  30d window, and per-day exports.
- **Dashboard → Request Inspector** — per-request rows with a live view.
- **Admin API** — `GET /admin/api/usage` (alias `/requests`) returns rows +
  summary.

## Exports (JSONL + CSV)

Per-day exports are written to `$KINETIX_DATA_DIR/exports`:

- `usage-<day>.jsonl` — one JSON object per usage row.
- `usage-<day>.csv` — a flat per-request table.
- `summary-<day>.csv` — day totals.

An hourly task exports the last 40 days (skipping days already exported) and
prunes files older than `KINETIX_EXPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30). You can also
export on demand from the dashboard or with `kinetix export run [--day DATE]`.

## Body logging (opt-in)

Off by default. When a virtual key sets `body_logging`, Kinetix stores a
**redacted** request body (every path) and, for non-streaming requests, a redacted
response body, retained 7 days and purged hourly. Streaming responses are **not**
buffered, so only their request is retained. Redaction replaces anything
that looks like a secret (`sk-`, `AIza`, `AQ.`, `gsk_`, `sk-ant`, `ya29.`).
