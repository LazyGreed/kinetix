# Routing and Fallback

A **Route** is a named routing policy that clients address like a model. It holds
an ordered list of **targets** (an account + upstream model, optionally with a
typed predicate and parameter overrides), a selection strategy, fallback triggers,
a state-portability policy, and optional prompt-cache affinity.

## Resolving a requested name

When a client asks for a model name, Kinetix resolves it in this order:

1. An **alias** with that name (exact match).
2. A **Route** with that name.
3. `provider/model-id` (provider matched by name or id).
4. A bare upstream model id.

Aliases point at either a single model (`target_type = "model"`) or a Route
(`target_type = "route"`).

## Targets

Each Route target names a model and may optionally pin one account. If the
account is omitted, the target owns the provider's executable account pool:
Kinetix applies account health, priority, and weight, then tries eligible sibling
accounts before advancing to the next logical Route target. Targets may span
providers and wire formats (FR-12.2/12.5/12.10).

## Selection strategies

| Strategy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `priority` | Try targets in priority order. |
| `round-robin` | Rotate the starting target per request. |
| `weighted` | Choose proportionally to target weight. |
| `least-used` | Prefer the target with the fewest lifetime requests. |
| `adaptive` | Prefer available target-local concurrency, then overload/error/TTFT telemetry. Cold TTFT uses the route-wide median observed TTFT as a neutral score. |

For `adaptive` routes, Kinetix holds a target-local concurrency permit for the
full upstream stream and records dispatch-to-first-semantic-event TTFT immediately.
First-event health is provisional while the stream is open: it can neutralize
older/no failure telemetry for routing, but only terminal success commits the
healthy EWMA sample. Failure signals are timestamped independently, so a newer
5xx/connection/overload from another request remains visible even while validated
streams are still open; a later error on the same stream likewise replaces its
provisional health with a real failure. Limit updates are wall-clock-window gated so request
density cannot accelerate concurrency growth. Failure/overload penalties decay
toward neutral with wall-clock time even when a target is idle, so transient
failures do not permanently sideline recovered targets. TTFT observations also
become cold after five minutes without a new sample, allowing a previously slow
target to return to the route's neutral TTFT baseline. Adaptive ordering runs only
after hard eligibility (predicate, provider restriction, capability, and context
checks). Within the remaining candidates, only currently dispatchable accounts
(healthy accounts plus legitimate circuit half-open probes) contribute adaptive
telemetry or represent a logical route target; unavailable siblings remain in the
fallback list but cannot shift its ranking. One immutable score is computed per
dispatchable route candidate for the whole ordering pass; cold TTFT candidates
receive the median observed TTFT of those eligible candidates. The Gradient2 queue
allowance scales with the current limit (capped at 4) rather than using a fixed
allowance equal to the initial limit. A 429 applies immediate loss backoff; a
timeout backs off only when the target was meaningfully loaded; generic
5xx/connection failures affect error telemetry without being treated as direct
congestion.

Cache/sticky affinity is applied after adaptive ordering. An eligible affine
target therefore stays preferred; if it is only concurrency-saturated Kinetix
waits briefly (bounded to 300 ms) before spilling to another target.

## Predicates (FR-12.3/12.4)

A target may carry a **typed, side-effect-free predicate** — an expression tree
with **three-valued** evaluation (`true` / `false` / `unknown`) and a
human-readable explanation. Arbitrary code/eval is forbidden. When a fact is
unknown, the target's `when_unknown` policy decides (`skip` by default, or
`allow`).

Fact vocabulary:

| Fact | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `has_tools` | The request carries tool definitions. |
| `has_images` | The request carries image parts. |
| `has_reasoning` | The request sets a thinking/reasoning control. |
| `frontend` | `openai` or `anthropic`. |
| `requested_model` / `requested_alias` / `requested_route` | Names the client used. |
| `key_tag` | The virtual key's tag. |
| `input_tokens` | Known input size. |
| `target_model` / `target_model_id` | The candidate model. |
| `target_provider` / `target_provider_id` | The candidate provider. |
| `target_capability(arg)` | A declared capability (unknown if unconfigured). |
| `target_context_window` / `target_max_output_tokens` | Model limits. |
| `plugin.<id>.<name>` | Typed fact contributed by an installed plugin (unknown if missing or stale). |

Wire format (as stored/returned by the admin API):

```json
{
  "expr": { "fact": "has_tools", "op": "eq", "value": true },
  "when_unknown": "skip"
}
```

`op` is one of `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte`, `in`, `not_in`, `contains`
(default `eq`). `fact` is a bare name string or `{ "name": ..., "arg": ... }`.

Example: send tool requests to a tool-capable model, everything else to a cheap
one:

```json
targets: [
  { "model": "Gemini/gemini-2.5-flash", "predicate": { "expr": { "fact": "has_tools", "op": "eq", "value": true } } },
  { "model": "9router/free",            "predicate": { "expr": { "fact": "has_tools", "op": "eq", "value": false } } }
]
```

### Plugin-contributed routing facts

Plugins implementing the `RoutingFactProvider` capability can export typed facts into the predicate engine:

* **Naming convention**: `plugin.<plugin-id>.<fact-name>` (e.g. `plugin.dev.example.geo.region` or `plugin.dev.example.compute.capacity_tier`).
* **Evaluation timing**: Fact providers run once per request before target candidate planning, caching values across the evaluation of all Route targets.
* **Determinism**:
  * `pure` fact providers are side-effect-free and forbidden from making outbound network calls.
  * `cached` fact providers periodically poll their upstream source. If a cached observation exceeds `max_age_ms`, it is dropped.
* **Failures and unknowns**: If a plugin fact provider times out, traps, or is disabled, the fact evaluates as `unknown`. The Route's `when_unknown` policy (`skip` or `allow`) then governs target eligibility.
* **Traceability**: The Route Trace records the evaluated fact values along with their source plugin ID and version, or the exact failure reason (e.g. timeout or circuit open).

## Fallback and the commit point (FR-4.5)

- Retry/fallback is allowed **only before the first client byte** (the *commit
  point*). The state machine is
  `SELECT → CONNECT → WAITING_FOR_FIRST_BYTE → COMMITTED → STREAMING/COMPLETE`.
- After commit, a failure **terminates the stream** with a format-correct error
  (OpenAI: an `error` object + a chunk with `finish_reason: "error"` + `[DONE]`;
  Anthropic: a single terminal `error` event). Nothing is silently spliced.
- The attempt loop is bounded by `max_attempts` (default 5, capped) and a 30-second
  pre-commit deadline, with bounded backoff between attempts (100 ms → 1 s).
- Account-scoped failures update account state: **429/rate limit → cooldown**
  (honoring `Retry-After`), **quota → exhausted**, and **auth → disabled**.
  Generic **5xx/connection/timeout** failures are request-local: they may trigger
  bounded retry/Route fallback before commit, but do not cool down the credential
  or increment its account circuit breaker.

## Portability policy (FR-2.11)

When a fallback crosses providers, opaque provider state (e.g. reasoning
signatures) cannot travel. The Route's `portability_policy` decides:

- `strip_with_warning` (default): remove the non-portable state, record it in the
  Route Trace, and emit an `X-Kinetix-Warning` response header. Silent stripping
  is forbidden.
- `reject`: fail the request with a format-correct error rather than stripping.

## Prompt-cache affinity (FR-7.3/7.5)

When a Route has `cache_affinity` or `sticky_routing` and the request carries
an explicit session header, Kinetix remembers the last successful target for that
session and prefers it while still eligible. `cache_affinity` is intended for
prompt-cache locality; `sticky_routing` is the general session-affinity switch.
It does **not** create or prove an upstream prompt-cache hit.

For Claude Code OAuth translated requests, Kinetix emits deterministic 1-hour
cache breakpoints on the stable system prefix and final cacheable tool definition.
Same-format Anthropic requests preserve valid client `cache_control` markers.
Actual cache behavior is reported from Anthropic
`cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens`; changing models is
a different upstream cache identity and a miss is expected.

Session identity is taken **only** from an explicit header — never guessed:

```
X-Kinetix-Session | X-Session-Id | X-Conversation-Id | X-Session-Affinity | Session-Id
```

## Client-visible routing headers (FR-12.15)

Clients see only opaque routing metadata:

| Header | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-Request-Id` | The request id. |
| `X-Kinetix-Route-Id` | Opaque `krt_…` id; resolvable to a Route Trace by an admin. |
| `X-Kinetix-Cache` | `hit` / `miss` / `bypass`. |
| `X-Kinetix-Fallback` | `1` when a fallback occurred (omitted otherwise). |
| `X-Kinetix-Warning` | JSON array of warnings (e.g. a portability strip). |

Serving account/provider names are **not** exposed to clients. An admin can
resolve the opaque id at `GET /admin/api/route-traces/{opaque_id}`.
